![Ping360 Settings](/ping-viewer/images/viewer/ping360-settings.png)

## Menu Items

- **Range:** adjust the distance from the sonar to scan signals. Smaller ranges will scan faster as the receiver does not have to wait as long to receive a response. Changes to this setting will automatically adjust the transmit duration (advanced setting) for best performance in most applications.
- **Receiver Gain:** Adjusts receiver sensitivity, choices are **low**, **medium** and **high**.
- **Sector Angle**: Choose full 360 scan, or select a smaller area to scan directly in front of the sonar.
- **Reset Settings:** Reset the settings in this panel to their default configuration.

#### Advanced Settings

> Click the arrow on the Device Settings menu to access these advanced settings

- **Transmit Duration:** Control the acoustic frequency.
- **Transmit Frequency:** Changes the frequency of the emitted pulse. Helps to adjust properties based in the signal's frequency.
- **Speed if Sound:** The speed of sound to be used for distance calculations. This should be 1500 m/s in salt water, 1450 m/s in fresh water. (it's not possible to use Ping360 in air!)
- **Angular Resolution:** Changes the step between each sample. Enables scanning a sector faster at the expense of a lower angular resolution.
